# Business Stream Designer

The business stream designer is a WYSIWYG design tool that allows end to end busineess streams to be defined in order to be able to provide conceptual view that can be more easily consumed by a broader audience. The tool makes all flows and agents across the estate available to be included in diagrams as well as the opportunity to define freeform integrated systems. The tool provides standard features often found in similar design tools, such as cut and paste, lines and shapes and a text tool.

Once saved, the business stream will be presented to the dashboard and will reflect the runtime state of the ESB.
